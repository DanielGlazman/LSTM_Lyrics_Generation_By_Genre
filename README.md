This project leverages the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to generate song lyrics conditioned by genreâ€”specifically Pop and Rap. The implementation is done using Python in a Google Colab notebook. The PyTorch library was used for the DL functionalities.

## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep-learning model capable of generating song lyrics that exhibit the characteristics of Pop and Rap genres. The model was trained on a subset of the [5 Million Song Lyrics Dataset available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilnayak123/5-million-song-lyrics-dataset/code), specifically focusing on randomly selected 10,000 songs (5000 from each genre). By training on these datasets, the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network learns to produce text that captures the stylistic elements and thematic content typical of Pop and Rap songs.
