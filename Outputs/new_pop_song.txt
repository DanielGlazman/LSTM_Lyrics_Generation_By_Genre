every morning the sun rises and every night the moon light 
 
 nanana and my girl i know i do 
 and when the tick glistening you think i got a key 
 i got a problem 'cause i got the heat yeah 
 
 maybe i'm not gonna be the type of magic 
 i will be your biggest friend 
 
 and i can't take you away 
 i don't know what the dream you got 
 i'll never let you go 
 i'll never sleep and i'd never let you down 
 
 i can't tell me falling down what i feel 
 i don't need it all i need is no love 
 but i need you to want me to know niggas all reupholstered these bastards 
 i'm in the mix and sipping green and yellow drink 
 
 oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 
 and i kick it all day crazy 
 i can feel your dance on me 
 i want to hear you roll ? 
 
 i wanna feel this way 
 and i can't explain i can't feel this love 
 sometimes i know 
 this is not my mind 
 it gets over me 
 
 cause i'm with you 
 i'm not a fire 
 i'm a real bitch 
 and i never talk bout it like a tambourine 
 don't tell me you should stand out here 
 and wherever you go 
 but we'll leave and rain is for you 
 
 it's broadway's what i need right now that you need a dj 
 
 get back up get up get up get up get up get up 
 
 get up get up get up 
 get up get up get up get up 
 everybody get up get up get up get up 
 get up get up get up 
 get up get up 
 get up get up get up get up get up 
 get up boy get up
