my_pop_song, by YUVAL FISHER

i was a little child when she came to me 
 her eyes in her eyes 
 then she was the only one she had me 
 
 the only one i gave her 
 every morning in the mirror it's all in the air 
 in a room its time to go on and on 
 
 dear boy dont you know that i'm alone ? 
 
 here they go you just keep the feeling 
 you know that you got it all i need 
 just like that you're this my way 
 you're my life i'm a prick 
 
 feel my own dream 
 to see the tears in my eyes 
 i do a lot of words 
 see i'm not afraid for you 
 and if you just love me 
 i will love you unconditionally 
 
 i love the love for you 
 i love you i love you 
 i love you i love you 
 i love you baby 
 
 i love you more than i love you 
 and i do what i do 
 i'm in love with the heart that i can't hear 
 it feels like i can't stop what i can 
 i got my money on the new track 
 show a kick up and be a fool 
 that's the way you never feel 
 and then i just wanna be here with you 
 
 my lady might never stop still in the night 
 
 i wanna see you say the time 
 i want you into my life 'cause i hate to be 
 i said i was counting on my bed like the bar on the side 
 
 she asked me when he was 
 and we got a hand in the crowd 
 and that's the reason 
 to the judge 
 with a new light 
 tiny widow hallelujah 
 if i will 
 i don't care if i could be 
 but i'm so robin 
 if i've been waiting for you to see 
 and i was hanging on the distant beat 
 i seen my parents so give the cool
