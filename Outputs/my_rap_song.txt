my_rap_song, by Yuval Fisher

i was a little child when she came to me 
 i said it's like that 
 you know when i'm gon get that bitch 
 i'm sick for that nigga yeah i want it to step 
 and that's right 
 come on and let me stay through 
 show me how i get top 
 check it yo it's a clique i got a suicide 
 but when my eyes go to sleep then i move a nigga 
 i wreck the new york nigga nigga i'll get the money 
 like it's so wrong 
 so i ain't never seen your baby 
 i'm always like this cursedass 
 
 here's me i'll just take a bitch a little bit 
 
 so take a bit of flowers 
 we can rely the streets bar at the store 
 so whoever already wreck the nigga who never had to flatten 
 hear the world that was enraged 
 but my girl was in the friend's i can't stand 
 it can see my life i will be a felony 
 i got this road i had sent to act so 
 especially i'm all about the shit nigga what the fuck 
 
 and i will not wishing what i am 
 and for what it's going to be so hot they said we got the same right here on the floor 
 
 i guess i never heard 
 
 if i was the big girl who would be me 
 who caught me on my side and i was looking 
 i got my own belief i got a friend for my friends 
 but i dont want to be 
 and you can't stand it again 
 
 you know what i mean you was real 
 you can't forget me but 
 you know why he would be through the shadows 
 i was a loser but it's been a patient and lyrics is leaded 
 hey hey ! we are the same boys for all y'all 
 the hate is a gangsta 
 that's what you know you got to get your balcony 
 and hold your hand and put your hands in your ass 
 put my lighters up the ice and erase my face 
 i get a hundred and i ain't caught it all too
